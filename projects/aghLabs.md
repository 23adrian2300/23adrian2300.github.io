## Term 3:

### "Probability and statistics"

The subject covered topics related to statistics and probability. As part of coding assignments, a program in the R language was to be implemented.

### "Object Oriented Programming"

The subject focused on learning the Java language. Additionally, we began to explore design patterns. During the labs, we developed applications, and later, we worked on a large project.
